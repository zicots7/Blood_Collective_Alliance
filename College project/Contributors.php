              Rohit's contributions as a final year BCA student played a
              crucial, albeit less visible, role in the success of the Blood
              Collective Alliance website. In his meticulous documentation no
              detail was too small, no decision left undocumented. Rohit's
              commitment to order and precision offered a vital counterpoint.
              His documentation served as a single source of truth, allowing the
              team to track progress, revisit key decisions, and make informed
              adjustments along the way.<br><a href='https://codepen.io/mariemosley/'>@Rohit</a>

              Debraj wasn't just a team player on the Blood Collective Alliance
              website; he was a cornerstone. His collaborative spirit fostered a

              C++, Java, and database management proved invaluable in tackling
              complex technical challenges. From back-end architecture to
              seamless data integration, Debraj's expertise played a pivotal
